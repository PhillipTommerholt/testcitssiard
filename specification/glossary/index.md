| **CSIP Implementation** | The E-ARK Common Specification for Information Packages mandates a set of restrictions and conventions that are applied to other standards to facilitate interoperability. One obvious example is the METS standard upon which the current CSIP is built. The CSIP specification is a long-term interoperability standard, and is not tied to a particular underlying standard. Were METS to be superceded by another standard in the future, it is desirable that the CSIP could be be implemented using the new standard. |
